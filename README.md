#### Note
Data for this extension is derived from the [Visual Studio Marketplace][VSMarketplaceURL] DOM, which is of course subject to change by Microsoft at anytime, and which would cause the  extension to cease functioning correctly. If this occurs the extension will inform the user and present them with details of how to inform the extension author - although I will have already spotted this myself of course.
